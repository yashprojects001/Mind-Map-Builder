# 🌌 Overview

**Mind Map Builder** is an interactive visual brainstorming and idea-mapping web application built using the HTML5 Canvas API.  
It allows users to create nodes, drag them freely across the canvas, and connect ideas visually using dynamic linking.

This tool simulates real professional software used for:
- 🧠 Brainstorming  
- 🧩 Concept mapping  
- 📚 Study planning  
- 💡 Idea organization  
- 🎯 Project structuring  

> Think visually. Connect ideas. Organize thoughts.

---

# 🧠 Core Concept

The application is designed as a **graph-based visual thinking tool** where:
- Each node represents an idea 🧩  
- Connections represent relationships 🔗  
- Canvas acts as an infinite workspace 🖥️  

This replicates real-world mind mapping software like:
> XMind • Miro • Whimsical • MindMeister

---

# 🚀 Key Features

## ➕ Dynamic Node Creation
- Add unlimited idea nodes
- Custom text input for each node
- Smart centered node placement
- Real-time rendering on canvas

---

## 🖱️ Drag & Drop Node System
- Smooth node dragging interaction
- Free movement across canvas
- Real-time position updates
- Intuitive UX for brainstorming flow

---

## 🔗 Connection Mapping (Graph Logic)
- Connect any two nodes visually
- Relationship linking between ideas
- Dynamic line rendering engine
- Multi-node network structure

---

## ❌ Delete Mode Functionality
- Remove nodes instantly
- Auto-remove related connections
- Clean workspace management
- Efficient editing workflow

---

## 🎨 Modern Software-Style UI
- Dark futuristic theme 🌌  
- Glassmorphism toolbar 💎  
- Neon glow node effects ✨  
- Minimal and distraction-free layout
